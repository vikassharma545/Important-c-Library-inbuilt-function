// A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is
// re-defined(Overridden) by a derived class.

// When you refer to a derived class object  using a pointer or a reference to the base
// class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s
// version of the function.

// They are mainly used to achieve Runtime polymorphism.
